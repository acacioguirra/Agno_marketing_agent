 So there has been massive updates with AI where you can combine images together to get hyper realistic videos like this one so here are all the updates. On this website you can upload a photo of yourself, a background and an item of clothing and try it on. You can also create 4K visuals of yourself now by uploading a photo and writing in a text prompt to customise it. You can create Hollywood level VFX that you would never be able to achieve in real life by just uploading a photo and writing in a text prompt. This website is called Pika and if you want access to it just type in AI in the comments and I'll send you a link so you can get started for free.
