 So here's a really cool trick for you to blend two images together in Photoshop. Start by dragging in a photo of yourself and then simply hit the remove background button. Now you can see along the edge of the t-shirt the grass isn't overlapping on top of the shirt making it obvious we've stuck it in. So to fix this, duplicate the grass layer and bring it on top. Then simply hold alt on the keyboard and click the layer mask icon. Now you've created an inverted layer mask, press B to activate the brush tool and using a grass brush you can paint along the edge of the t-shirt blending the grass on top of the shirt. Now if you don't have a grass brush, just type in grass in the comments and I'll send you this brush for free. But now you can add some shadows using an exposure layer to blend it all together.
