 So you can now use AI to edit any image and then bring it to Google VO3 to turn it into a video. Which means I can create images of myself. And using OpenArt, I can now edit anything about myself so I can create unlimited content. On OpenArt, where they have all the best image and video models, make sure you have Flux Context Max selected and scroll down to the Omni Reference section. From here, you can drag and drop in a photo that you'd like to edit. Then you can write in the prompt describing what you'd like to change. Now in seconds, you've changed your photo. And you can even create your own character by uploading multiple photos of yourself and you can even make a music video. If you want access to the tool, type AI in the comments and I'll send you a link.
