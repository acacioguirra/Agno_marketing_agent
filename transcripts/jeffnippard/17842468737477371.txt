 Losing muscle could cost you your life. Muscle isn't just for looking jacked. It's also one of the most powerful predictors of how long you'll live. And today I'm speaking at Harvard Med about why having bigger biceps could save your life. You see, your muscles not only stretch and contract, they also act like a sponge, pulling sugar out of your blood. This keeps your blood sugar stable, which lowers your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and even some types of cancer. And people with more muscle don't just live longer, they also live better. Lifting weights stimulates your brain too. This sharpens your memory, your focus, and lowers your risk of dementia. It also strengthens your bones, which reduces your risk of fracture. That could be the difference between walking and a wheelchair. But here's the best part. It doesn't take much. Even just two full body workouts a week can help you stay strong to keep doing the things that give your life meaning. So keep lifting. Your future self will thank you.
