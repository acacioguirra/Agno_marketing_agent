 Here are my top three quad exercises of all time. In third place, the Bulgarian split squat. These are super effective for quad growth and probably would be my number one pick, if not for how brutally fatiguing they are. Because they're so draining, I only do two sets per workout. In second place, the leg extension. Turns out, leg extensions are actually much better for growing the big rectus femoris head of the quads than squats. That's most likely because your hips are fixed on a leg extension, which allows the multi-joint rectus femoris head to actually stretch and squeeze. You could actually argue that the leg extension is the best quad exercise since it hits all four heads better than squats. But since some leg extension machines don't allow you to get quite as deep as I like, I'm leaving it in second place. My number one quad builder beats out the leg extension mainly because of its enormous capacity for progressive overload. And in the real world, it just seems to lead to the best results. It's the squat. You can squat any way you like. Barbell, Smith machine, hack squat, they'll all blow up your quads.
