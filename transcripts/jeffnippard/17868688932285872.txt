 He always trains according to the latest science, and he trains like a bro. Who do you think will build more muscle? I honestly think it's a good question. I bet a lot of my audience would say the science guy. That's because he's tapped into the new and optimized methods. But I bet a lot of the bodybuilding community would say the bro will build more muscle because he trains harder. Let's break it down. The science guy would know from a pile of research that you need to get really close to failure to maximize muscle growth. If he isn't training really hard, he's not really science-based. And the bro will have figured out that doing a variety of different exercises to target the muscle from different angles is a good idea. And the science guy could provide a study to support that. Assuming they both stay natural, I do think the science guy would build more muscle and be less likely to get injured over the long term. But they'll both make gains, and the practical difference between them probably isn't as big as it seems.
