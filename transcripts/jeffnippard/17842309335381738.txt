 All right, this is my leg workout based on science and experience. Up first, the seated leg curl for the hamstrings. This gets my knees nice and warm for squats, and I usually pick seated over lying leg curls because this study showed they cause about 1.5 times more muscle growth. Next, I do Smith machine squats for the quads and glutes. Here, I get as deep as I can and explode out of the hole. Doing these on the Smith allows me to push my last set to failure without worrying about dumping the bar. After that, it's the Romanian deadlift for the glutes and hamstrings. Here I focus on pushing my hips back without allowing my lower back to round. Using straps on these is smart. Your glutes and hams should be stronger than your grip. Then I do leg extensions for the quads. Here I set the seat back to get a deep stretch in the rectus femoris. On my last set, I do mile reps beyond failure. Basically, rest for a few seconds, crank another three reps, and repeat. Then I superset two sets of hip adductions for the inner thighs with two sets of hip abductions for the glutes, and then four sets of standing calf raises.
