 This is my brother Brad, and he's the only person in our family who doesn't lift, until now. Push it, push it, push it! For the next 365 days, we're both doing a challenge to see who can pack on more muscle. I'm starting at 165 pounds and 15% body fat. Brad's also 165 pounds, but he's 36% body fat. Oh, it hurts so much. We're lifting five days a week, every last set to failure. No exceptions. Brad is doing awesome. I'm noticing that my social anxiety is almost gone. And that was debilitating at times. But I put on 11 pounds of fat during our bulk. So we started our cut to get back to our starting weight. And after one year, I put on 2.7 pounds of lean mass. Not bad for someone with 15 years of training. But Brad, he put on 10 pounds of lean mass. And his body fat dropped from 36 to 29%. And he's still going. This is what he looks like now showing off the family genes.
