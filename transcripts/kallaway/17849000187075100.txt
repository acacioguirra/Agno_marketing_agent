 Hollywood is not happy with Taylor Swift, because it turns out she may have just broken the film industry. This weekend, Taylor debuted her ERA's tour film. It's already done $100 million in ticket sales. For reference, that's the sixth highest of any movie this year, in the same category as Spider-Man and Barbie. But it's not the ticket sales that's making Hollywood mad, it's the split. Because in a savage business move, she completely cut them out. A normal movie looks something like this. There's four main parties, the movie producers, the Hollywood studios, AMC, and the local theaters. Now typically, the movie producer will sell the film rights to a Hollywood studio, because the studios control the relationship with AMC and have the money to fund the marketing to get eyes on the trailers. You don't use the studio, your movie's not getting seen. Now all four parties get a cut of the profit, but guess who gets the majority? The studios. They take up to 70% of the income from the opening weekend. But Taylor said, hold on a minute, why do we need a Hollywood studio? I can pay for the filming myself and I have a massive audience. With one Instagram post, I can get tens of millions of people to know about this movie. So she cut them out. She made a deal directly with AMC. All three groups made more money and Hollywood got nothing. Now believe it or not, Hollywood isn't that mad about Taylor's movie specifically. I'm sure they would have loved to have made 70 million with zero effort, but their problem is much bigger than that. What they're really mad about is that she broke into the vault and shared the secret recipe for how to beat them. Now any group of actors with an audience has a playbook for going direct. And Taylor wins again.
