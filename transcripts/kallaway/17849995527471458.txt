 This is the future of online shopping. And I don't think people realize how easy AI shopping is about to get. Look at this. You can now upload a single photo of yourself and try on billions of clothes instantly. But here's the crazy part. These aren't just shirts or dresses photoshopped on your body. Google built an AI fashion model that actually understands how different fabrics stretch and drape across your specific body. So it looks way more accurate than it possibly could before. Now, the implications of this are pretty insane. Everyone in the world is gonna have a custom digital mannequin that actually looks like them. Height, size, depth, everything. And when you combine this with Google Shopping's 50 billion products and their world-class recommendations, you can literally go from chat to virtual try-on in seconds. But as mind-blowing as that is, here's where I think all this goes. In just a couple years, Google will allow anyone to create their own personal shopping avatar that will show up on any fashion site on the internet. So instead of guessing if the Lululemon model's fit is gonna work for you, you'll become the model instantly on any site you want. And this means less returns, less waste, and 100x better shopping experience. In essence, the entire internet is going to become one giant digital fitting room, all personalized for you. And I think this is going to make online shopping way more fun.
