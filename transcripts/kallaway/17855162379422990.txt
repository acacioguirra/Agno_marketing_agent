 Check this out. This would be the holy grail for video editors. It's literally magic editing with AI. You upload the raw clips, you tell it what you want in words, and then it does the rest, a full automatic edit. This is called Ponder.ai. It's going super viral on Twitter. Now, when it comes to these AI products, I'll be the first to admit, there's a huge difference between a teaser video and a fully functional product. And this is still in teaser stage. But if there's one AI product for video creation that I would pay a thousand bucks a month for, it's this. Not only will it auto cut and sequence the clips for you, but you can highlight a specific portion and then re-prompt a spot fix. And they're also building in style transfer. So you can upload videos from other creators. It will match their style and then apply it to yours. And ideally, that would work for cut pacing as well as motion-based animation. Now, I don't know if these two guys are going to be the ones that crack this, but whoever does, it's a billion-dollar company. This is Tony Stark speaking to Jarvis to edit videos. Imagine walking around the room describing how you want the video edited and then it happening in real time. If you're a creator, make sure to keep an eye on this one.
