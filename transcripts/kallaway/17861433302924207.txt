 If you work in any of these jobs, I'm talking banking, marketing, sales, consulting, any business job, any corporate job, AI is coming. And it's going to start affecting your day-to-day in the next one to two years. So what do you do? If you want to keep your job, here's the playbook. Become the person at your company that understands AI. If you become the AI expert, your leadership, the Ronalds, Karens, Freds of the world, will do everything they can to keep you because they're not going to be able to understand it themselves. So the real question is, how do you become the AI expert for your company? And here's the answer. You follow people that are spending 100% of their time on AI. They're in the trenches all day long, learning, experimenting, sharing. I consider myself one of these people. Here's a list of some others that I love. If you're not full-time on this stuff, the pace of change is just way too fast for you to keep up. My only goal right now is taking all the craziness that's happening and simplifying it down so that other people can learn about it. If you think that would help you, welcome aboard.
