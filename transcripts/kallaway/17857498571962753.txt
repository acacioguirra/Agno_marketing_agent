 People are scanning their eyes in exchange for free money. 2.1 million of them. But here's what's crazy. There are massive lines all around the world waiting for their turn. This is WorldCoin, the wildest social human money experiment ever created. WorldCoin started with a simple vision. What if there was one global financial network owned by everybody on Earth? Unhackable, no corruption. Sounds pretty great. But here's where it gets a little dicey for me. In order to make that kind of system, every person needs one unique ID. Think of it like a login that can't be stolen or hacked. And the team decided the best way to do this was to scan your iris, the colored part of your eye. Because other options like face ID, palm scan, or even email could be hacked or manipulated by AI. So you look into this silver orb and it verifies that you're uniquely you and a human. They call it proof of personhood. In exchange, you're officially verified on the network. And they give you some tokens, currently worth about 50 bucks. Call it a sign-up bonus. Now the idea is if they're able to grow this network with enough proven humans, businesses will start to build for it. You know, like we take MasterCard, Visa, Apple Pay, Eyes. In the best case, it could become the new financial rails, like what crypto originally promised, but without the scams. But here's the craziest part where it starts to get a little spooky for me. The co-founder of WorldCoin is Sam Altman. And you might know that name. He's also the co-founder of OpenAI, which made ChatGPT and basically kick-started this whole AI revolution. He said this, In the future, when AI is super powerful, we're gonna need this.
