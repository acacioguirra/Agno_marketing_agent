 OpenAI just announced their latest breakthrough innovation, AI agents. They're calling them GPTs. These are tailored versions of ChatGPT designed for specific use cases. But here's what's crazy. I think these agents will have a bigger impact on the world than the original version of ChatGPT. Think of these agents kind of like apps on your phone. Uber lets you call a car. FaceTime lets you call a friend. GPTs are the next generation of apps, but with AI superpowers. Here's a Canva GPT that lets you design posters just by chatting with them. You don't need to know how to use Canva or even design principles. You just need to know how to type into a computer. Now the craziest example I saw was using Zapier to connect 6,000 apps together. Gmail, Slack, Calendar, everything that you use every single day. So GPTs become your one command center for everything. There'll be no need to even open other websites. But here's the craziest part of all. OpenAI designed GPTs so they can be built without needing to code. All you have to do is have a chat conversation with the builder and you'll have a new GPT in minutes. Now, if you've been playing with ChatGPT for a while, you'll know that OpenAI already launched plugins. Well, think of GPTs like the next generation of plugins, but way easier to build and improve without needing code. It's going to open up the ability for customizing AI to everyone. Now, OpenAI is planning to launch their GPT app store soon, and it's going to offer a revenue share to the people that build the most popular GPTs. It's going to be a huge money-making opportunity for early adopters. I think this is the moment where AI applications get extremely useful extremely quickly. I'd pay attention to this.
